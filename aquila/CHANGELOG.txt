2.4.3
 + optimized DTW calculation
 + added DTW lowest-cost path recovery
 + added two different DTW pass types - neighbors and diagonals

2.4.2
 + added different distance functions to DTW

2.4.1
 + fixed a nasty bug in MfccExtractor concerning enabling Mel filters

2.4.0
 + ported DTW calculation from 1.3.1
 + allowed for different DTW distance normalizations

2.3.2
 + added MelFiltersBank::setEnabledFilters() to allow mass enabling/disabling
   Mel filters
 + added FeatureReader::readHeader()

2.3.1
 + added WaveFile::recalculate() method for quick frame recalculating
   without the need to reload whole file

2.3.0
 + redesigned reading/writing of feature objects
 + created FeatureReader and FeatureWriter interfaces

2.2.1
 + added sample by sample access to WaveFile class
 + Transform class is non-static (again :-P)

2.2.0
 + ported MFCC feature extraction from 1.3.1

2.1.0
 + ported Mel-scale filters

2.0.2
 + optimized FFT calculations

2.0.1
 + sample preparing and Fourier transform is handled by the Transform class
 + Frame and WaveFile now do not depend on any other classes

2.0.0
 + ported some of old classes from 1.3.1 to new project
 + huge refactoring of old code
 + reduced dependency between objects
 + separated configuration from calculation
