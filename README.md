[OLD & UNMAINTAINED] SimpleBird
===============================

This is a source code dump of a signal processing software I have been developing around 2009-2010. It was a (rather expansive) rewrite of my student project to recognize birds' voices.

The code is (mostly) a mess with mixed Polish/English names and comments. There will be **no further development** in this repository. However, I may reuse some of the ideas I implemented here in other projects.
